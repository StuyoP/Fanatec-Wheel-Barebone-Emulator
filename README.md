# Fanatec-Wheel-Barebone-Emulator
Berebone Emulator for Fanatec Wheelbase allowing you to create DIY Steering Wheels with full Button, display, LED support.
This project is quite easy to be built with using standard 70x30mm breadboard, JST-XH 2.54 pitch connector and ATmega238P chip. This keeps price, production time and ease of build to minimum. Also the resulcting emulator has pretty low footprint so it perfectly fits in a Podium Hub Shell, for example.
I already build several emulators, each with different periferals and custom code.
